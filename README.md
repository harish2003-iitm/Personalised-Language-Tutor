- Provides an accurate text representation of spoken content for further analysis.

### üåç **2. Text Translation**
- Translates transcribed text into the target language specified by the user.
- Utilizes OpenAI's **GPT-4o-mini** model for precise and contextual translations.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **3. Grammar Feedback**
- Analyzes translated text for grammatical errors.
- Suggests corrections and refinements to improve the quality of the user's writing.

### üó£Ô∏è **4. Pronunciation Feedback**
- Evaluates user pronunciation by comparing the original transcription with a user-defined target sentence.
- Offers personalized suggestions for improving pronunciation accuracy and clarity.

## **Workflow**

### **1. Audio Upload**
   - Users upload an audio file (`data/sample.wav`) to the system.

### **2. Transcription**
   - The uploaded audio is transcribed into text using OpenAI's **Whisper-1** model.
   - The transcribed text is stored in a variable called `transcription_text`.

### **3. Translation**
   - The transcription text is translated into the desired language specified by the user.
   - The translated text is stored in a variable called `translated_text`.

### **4. Grammar Feedback**
   - The translated text is analyzed for grammatical errors, and corrections are suggested.
   - The corrected version is stored in a variable called `grammar_feedback`.

### **5. Pronunciation Feedback**
   - User pronunciation is evaluated by comparing the transcription with a user-defined target sentence.
   - Personalized feedback is provided, stored in a variable called `pronunciation_feedback`.
